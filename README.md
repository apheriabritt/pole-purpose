3 CARD MIX
Max 3 cards, otherwise too complicated from choreo point of view.
I’m totally with you on trying to get it more simply or in one place somehow.
Maybe incorporate the link to the 3 cards mix with icons
across the bottom on the main page?*

SAVED SETS
User can pick 3 to save – that’s a great idea and will cross the bridge more
between the physical cards and the app [call it “saved sets” rather than routines
it will fit in with original how-to-text]. That’s how we wanted it originally for
the notes to be linked to sets, but either it was language barrier with the previous
developer, or he just couldn’t do it.

FAVOURITES
Can you make is so you can favourite cards as well?

*MAIN PAGE
As well as hamburger menu, on bottom of screen have to option to do all of the above?
E.g. 3 card mix / favourite / randomise cards button
