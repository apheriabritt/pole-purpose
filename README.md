Hi Britt,

Apple still take too big a cut in comparison to PayPal
- something like 15% vs 3%. For now, the ideal interim stage would be for the classes to pull from the website
but then when it comes to actually purchasing to link back out to the website.
It's tricky, because in app purchase I think would gain more trust, but apple/play store have too much control in terms of refunds etc.
If the app takes off and class sales increase, then I think it will be worth it.

Shadow - yes looks great now yay, well done! I can see it slides in differently, it's all looking cool!
The swipe to browse doesn't work anymore on the home page (sorry!) you can swipe, but it remains on the same card.

Favourites - I've just realised something. When you go into the favourite section,
there's no obvious way to un-favourite the card/cards unless you're viewing them from the home page.
Which isn't so bad for singular cards, but in sets of three, you'd have to land on the same set of 3 again.
Can you add a favourite and an un-favourite button when you open the cards on long tap?

- online classes integration
- swipe to browse home page iOS
- unfavourite from favourites
