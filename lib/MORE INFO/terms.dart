  "If you have a dispute with Polepurpose.com, and you are unable to resolve the dispute informally, you and Polepurpose.com agree that upon demand by either you or Polepurpose.com, the dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration. As the sole exception to arbitration, you and PolePurpose.com each retain the right to pursue in small claims court any dispute that is within that court’s jurisdiction. A “dispute” is any unresolved disagreement between you and PolePurpose.com, regardless of when the claim arose, and includes claims based on contracts, torts, statutes, regulations, common law, and equitable claims. All statutes of limitation applicable to any dispute shall apply in any arbitration between you and PolePurpose.com.\nYou and PolePurpose.com agree that you are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a court. You and PolePurpose.com agree that each may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity, and that neither you nor PolePurpose.com shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims by or against others in any arbitration, or to include in any arbitration any dispute as a representative or member of a class, or on behalf of the general public, or as a private attorney general. If this limitation is found to be unenforceable, it shall not be severable, and this entire arbitration provision shall be unenforceable. You and PolePurpose.com agree that the arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favour of the party seeking relief, and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. In the event of any inconsistency between this arbitration provision and any provision contained in any other applicable terms of use, license agreement, disclaimer, or privacy policy relating to PolePurpose.com or the material on the website, this arbitration provision shall be controlling.\nEach arbitration, including the selection of the arbitrator, will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) according to its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedure for Consumer-Related Disputes (together, the “AAA Rules”). The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7979. In the event of any inconsistency between the AAA Rules and this arbitration provision, this arbitration provision shall be controlling. Either party may demand arbitration of a dispute at any time, regardless of whether a lawsuit or other proceeding has previously been commenced. Either party may demand arbitration by completing the form for Consumer-Related Disputes provided for that purpose, and following the instructions on the form. The form is available on the AAA’s website, www.adr.org, or by calling AAA Case Filing Services at 1-877-495-4185. You should attach a copy of this arbitration provision, which will remain available online. If you demand arbitration, you must send a copy of the form or other demand, by U.S. Certified Mail, addressed to: Pole Purpose, Attention: Legal Department, P.O. Box 5100, Carlsbad, CA 92010-5100. If PolePurpose.com demands arbitration, you will be sent a copy of the form or other demand, by U.S. Certified Mail, at the most current postal address that PolePurpose.com has for you in its records. If your claim is for less than \$10,000, PolePurpose.com will pay all of the AAA’s administrative fees and the arbitrator’s fees, including the initial filing fee. If your claim is for more than \$10,000, and applicable law limits the amount of arbitration fees payable by you, PolePurpose.com will pay all of the AAA’s administrative fees and the arbitrator’s fees in excess of this limitation. Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, each party will remain solely responsible for their own attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration.\nYou and PolePurpose.com agree that: (1) the parties are participating in transactions affecting interstate commerce; (2) this arbitration provision and any resulting arbitration are governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code); (3) the arbitrator shall decide any dispute regarding the interpretation, application, or enforceability of this arbitration provision; (4) neither party will disclose, to any third party, any information obtained from the other party in the arbitration proceeding, except as required by applicable law; and (5) neither party will be entitled to rely on any arbitration award, finding of fact, or conclusion of law issued in any other arbitration proceeding involving only one of the parties. This arbitration provision shall survive the termination of any other contract between you and PolePurpose.com.",
